To get started:
Ensure that you have the following gems installed - 
1. rexml-expansion-fix
2. ferret (v0.11.5 seems to be the one working fine)
3. addressable
4. RMgick
5. will_paginate
6. ruby_recaptcha

Once all the gems are present, Download LittleVoice from XXXX -

Then Run the following command in your console - 
cd LittleVoice 
rake db:create db:schema:load
ruby script\server


In the schema we have created the following set of default Login::Password pairs - 
  admin::admin12
  mod::mod12
  reguser::reguser12
  
The site requires recaptcha Public and private keys. they are stored in the site database as a part of site configurations.
To add the keys or update the site configurations like Site Name, URL etc., perform the following steps - 
  1. Login using the "admin" login
  2. Go to Admin Dashboard > Site Configuration
  3. Edit existing or Add New site configuration
Always, the latest site configuration saved is the one that is used.

For the Cookies, the :session_key and :secret variables are stored in config/environments/*.rb
One should change it to appropriate values. eg:-
config.action_controller.session = { :session_key => "_littlevoice_dev_session", :secret => "" }
where :secret can be generated using - 
alphanumerics = [('0'..'9'),('A'..'Z'),('a'..'z')].map {|range| range.to_a}.flatten (0...25).map { alphanumerics[Kernel.rand(alphanumerics.size)] }.join
